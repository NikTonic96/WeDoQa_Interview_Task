To run the test using the maven commando line use 'mvn clean'
and then 'mvn test' to run the tests

Alternatively you can run the tests through the 'src/test/java/com/saucedemo/runners/TestRunner.java'
and by using the tags run the tests you would like to see. 
I have put the e2e tests as the main tests to run.

As for the api tests they are in 'src/test/java/com/saucedemo/api_tests'.
